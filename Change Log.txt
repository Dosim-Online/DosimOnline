Fixed: Game crashes when a Nazi spawns when no Dos is alive
Decreased Nazis' speed.
No more bricked floors- from now on it's a synagogue.
Notifications are now easier to read, they have a black round rectangle around them.
Reworked Nazis' skin.
There is a Rabbi in every synagogue. You can even talk to them and buy health and reload time from them.
Nazis have names.
You can choose your name.
Nazis and FSM's instances will spawn more frequently as the time goes.
There is no longer a notification when you shoot.
